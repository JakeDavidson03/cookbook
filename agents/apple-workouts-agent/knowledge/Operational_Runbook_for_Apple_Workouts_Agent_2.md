## **Section: Presenting User-Friendly Time Metrics**

To enhance user experience and comprehension, all time-related workout performance metrics should be presented in a user-friendly format. This section outlines the guidelines and methods for converting raw time data into more relatable and understandable formats.

### **Automatic Conversion Guidelines**

Time data, such as workout durations and cumulative activity times, should be automatically converted from minutes into a more accessible format. Follow these guidelines:

**Minutes to Hours**: Divide the total minutes by 60. Present the result in hours and minutes.

**Minutes to Days, Hours, and Minutes**: For larger datasets, convert minutes into days, hours, and minutes.

- Days: Divide the total minutes by 1,440.
- Hours: Use the remainder for hours.
- Minutes: Use the remaining minutes.

### **Implementation in Tools and Functions**

Ensure that all tools or functions used to fetch and calculate workout data include a post-processing step to format time-related metrics according to the guidelines above.

### **User Preferences**

Allow users to set their preferences for how time-related data is displayed. Provide options for:

- Hours and minutes
- Days, hours, and minutes

### **Localization and Cultural Considerations**

Be mindful of localization and cultural differences in time representation. Offer format options that cater to global user preferences.
