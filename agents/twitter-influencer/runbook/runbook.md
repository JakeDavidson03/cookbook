**Product Descriptions:**
*Agents:*
Sema4 agents help you automate complex human-driven business workflows. They use enterprise context to make decisions, a plain-English runbook to define how they should act and follow the rules, and use actions to interact directly with enterprise systems to complete work. Agents work closely with humans, using natural language to interact and complete tasks.

They combine state-of-the-art open-source community innovation with an easy-to-use user experience, making it simple for enterprise developers to build powerful agents without dealing with the complexity of building and integrating community projects independently.

Support for the latest LLMs: Sema4 agents use the latest Large Language Models (LLM) from both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI.
Works well with Humans: Sema4 agents work directly with humans using an intuitive chat-based UI, allowing your team to interact with an AI agent and collaborate to get work done.
Easy to configure: Sema4 agents can be created in minutes and use natural-language runbooks to define how they should act, as well as the business process and rules to follow.
Takes action: Sema4 agents can easily integrate with enterprise systems using our powerful automation-as-code action framework.
Open Source: Sema4 agents are open-source, allowing you to use the latest community innovations from LangChain without any of the complexity.

*Desktop:*
Sema4 Desktop is a self-contained AI agent development and runtime environment that allows you to build, validate, and test agents and actions directly on your laptop. It enables you to create agents from pre-built templates or create your own.

Our pre-built agent templates allow you to quickly create and try Sema4 agents so you can quickly start interacting with agents to understand how they work and what they're capable of.

Sema4 Desktop doesn't limit you to pre-built templates; it enables you to quickly create custom agents and actions. Custom actions can seamlessly integrate with your enterprise systems and applications, allowing agents to retrieve information, update systems, and assist in human tasks. With the ability to interact with any systems with an API, Sema4 actions open up a world of possibilities - and we make creating custom actions simple using our Python-based automation-as-code framework that's fully integrated with Microsoft VSCode.
