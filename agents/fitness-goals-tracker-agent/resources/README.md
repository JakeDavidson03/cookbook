# **Use Case - Fitness Goals Tracker**

The Fitness Goals Tracker Agent is designed to help you achieve your fitness objectives by integrating multiple productivity tools and data sources. This agent combines the capabilities of Google Sheets, Google Drive, and Gmail with Apple Health's workout data to provide a comprehensive fitness tracking and reporting system.

## [**Example Scenario: Fitness Goals Tracker**](https://sema4.ai/docs/usecases/gsuite-data-integ-fitness-goal-tracker/fitness-goals-tracker#example-scenario-fitness-goals-tracker)

Consider the task of tracking fitness goals and updating progress:

**Data Retrieval**: The agent fetches fitness data from the Apple Health app, including all workout data. Behind the scenes, this data is stored in a MongoDB-like SQLite database, but the focus is on the comprehensive workout and fitness data from the app.

**Data Analysis**: This is done via a set of Action endpoints that the agent has access to as part of the Vitality Workouts Action Group.

**Report Generation**: The agent not only generates a progress report in Google Sheets but also has the ability to pinpoint specific cells within an existing Google spreadsheet and update them with the latest data. The agent/LLM can automatically detect pre-processing needed before data insertion and perform post-processing updates to other cells in the sheet. It can also update multiple sheets (across different months of analysis) in parallel. Metrics include:

*   Running Distance (miles)
*   Running Duration (hours)
*   Walking Distance (miles)
*   Walking Duration (hours)
*   Core Duration (hours)
*   Active Calories (calories)
*   Avg Heart Rate (bpm)
*   Max Heart Rate (bpm)

**Email Notification**: The agent sends an email via Gmail with the progress report attached, using a template fetched from Google Drive.
