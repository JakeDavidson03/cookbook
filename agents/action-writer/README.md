## Action Writer Agent
Great agents rely on actions, but what happens when you can't find an action you need? This agent helps you quickly write new actions using publicly available API documentation. It will:

* Find and use depdendencies
* Write a function that works with our Action framework, including using Secrets to handle sensitive parameters
* Create input data
* Create all of this in VSCode allowing you to review your Action
* Quickly test your action with an agent and suggest changes based on errors observed

## Example Conversation
```Help me create an action to send a message to my Vestaboard using this API: https://docs.vestaboard.com/docs/read-write-api/endpoints/```
