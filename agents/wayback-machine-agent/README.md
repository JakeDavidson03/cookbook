## Wayback Machine Agent
Ever wonder what's changed on a website over time? How has a competitor changed their messaging, what are they focussing on now that they weren't before, or even how their website structure has changed and what that may mean?

Well - we've got an agent for that. This agent will help you answer those questions by simply asking it ```how has competitor.com changed over the last 60 days```. It will summarize changes and show you the results.

It uses the [Wayback Machine](https://wayback-api.archive.org/) to access previous versions of the website, and uses Google to fetch the contents and compare. The Wayback Machine can take some time, so be patient.

When creating this agent make sure you import the actions and also use the **Search and Browse** action from Sema4.ai

Have fun!
