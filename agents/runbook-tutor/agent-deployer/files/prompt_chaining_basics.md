# Prompt Chaining Basics

## Overview
Prompt chaining involves using the output from one interaction as the input for the next, creating a sequence of tasks that build on each other. This technique allows for more complex and nuanced interactions with LLMs, as each step in the chain can refine, expand, or redirect the information flow based on previous outputs.

## How It Works
The process starts with an initial prompt to which the model responds. This response is then used as the basis for the next prompt, either directly or with modifications, guiding the model through a series of interconnected tasks. This method is particularly useful for multi-step reasoning, exploring different facets of a topic, or progressively narrowing down to specific details.

## Examples

### Example 1: Story Development
**Prompt 1**: "Write a brief opening for a mystery story set in a small coastal town."

**Response 1**: "The fog hung low over Raven's Cove, a small town known for its quaint shops and a history of unexplained disappearances."

**Prompt 2**: "Using the setting from the previous response, introduce a main character who is a detective."

**Response 2**: "Detective Laura Marlin, known for her sharp wit and keen observation skills, arrived in Raven's Cove, drawn by the whispers of mystery that seemed to shroud the town."

**Prompt 3**: "Continue the story by describing the detective's first clue."

**Response 3**: "Laura's first clue was a cryptic note found under the door of her cabin, its message scrawled in a hurried, almost frantic hand: 'Beware the midnight tide.'"

### Example 2: Exploring a Concept
**Prompt 1**: "Explain the basic principles of blockchain technology."
**Response 1**: "Blockchain technology is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across many computers in a way that prevents alteration, ensuring transparency and security."

**Prompt 2**: "Based on the previous explanation, what are potential applications of blockchain outside of cryptocurrencies?"
**Response 2**: "Beyond cryptocurrencies, blockchain can revolutionize various sectors, including supply chain management, secure voting systems, and digital identity verification."

**Prompt 3**: "Considering its applications in supply chain management, how can blockchain improve transparency?"
**Response 3**: "In supply chain management, blockchain can provide a transparent and immutable record of product origins, handling, and transactions, thereby enhancing trust and accountability."

### Example 3: Problem Solving
**Prompt 1**: "What are common causes of urban traffic congestion?"
**Response 1**: "Common causes include road construction, accidents, poor traffic signal timing, and a high volume of vehicles, especially during peak hours."

**Prompt 2**: "Considering the causes identified, propose a solution to reduce congestion."
**Response 2**: "One solution could be the implementation of smart traffic management systems that optimize signal timing and provide real-time traffic updates to drivers."

**Prompt 3**: "How can technology, specifically mobile apps, support your proposed traffic management solution?"
**Response 3**: "Mobile apps can integrate with smart traffic systems to offer drivers alternate routes, predict traffic patterns, and suggest optimal departure times to avoid congestion."

## Conclusion
Prompt chaining allows for a dynamic and iterative interaction with LLMs, enabling more detailed exploration and complex problem-solving. By building on each response, users can guide the model through intricate lines of inquiry or creative storytelling.
