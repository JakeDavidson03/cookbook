# Chain-of-Thought Basics

## Overview
Chain-of-Thought prompting is a technique used with Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex problems by guiding the model through a series of intermediate reasoning steps. This approach helps the model to break down a task into smaller, more manageable parts, making it easier to arrive at a final solution or conclusion.

## How It Works
In Chain-of-Thought prompting, the user structures the prompt to explicitly outline a logical sequence of thoughts or steps that lead to the solution of a problem. This not only aids the model in understanding the problem-solving process but also encourages it to generate outputs that reflect this structured approach to reasoning.

## Examples

### Example 1: Complex Math Problem
**Prompt**: 
"Solve the following math problem using step-by-step reasoning: If a train travels 60 miles in 1.5 hours, how long will it take to travel 120 miles at the same speed?

**Chain-of-Thought**:
1. First, find the speed of the train by dividing the distance by the time: Speed = 60 miles / 1.5 hours.
2. Then, use the speed to calculate the time to travel 120 miles: Time = Distance / Speed."

**Expected Response**: The model calculates the speed of the train in the first step and then uses that speed to find the time required to travel 120 miles, presenting a clear, step-by-step solution.

### Example 2: Logical Reasoning Question
**Prompt**: 
"Using reasoning, determine who is the tallest among Alex, Ben, and Carol if Alex is taller than Ben, and Carol is taller than Alex.

**Chain-of-Thought**:
1. Start by comparing Alex and Ben: Alex is taller than Ben.
2. Next, compare Carol and Alex: Carol is taller than Alex.
3. Since Carol is taller than Alex, and Alex is taller than Ben, Carol is the tallest."

**Expected Response**: The model follows the outlined reasoning steps to deduce that Carol is the tallest among the three.

### Example 3: Science Problem
**Prompt**: 
"Explain why the sky is blue using step-by-step reasoning.

**Chain-of-Thought**:
1. Sunlight consists of light of different colors, each with a different wavelength.
2. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with air molecules, scattering the light in all directions.
3. Blue light has a shorter wavelength and is scattered more than other colors, making the sky appear blue to our eyes."

**Expected Response**: The model provides an explanation for why the sky is blue, breaking down the phenomenon into a sequence of logical steps.

### Example 4: Puzzle Solving
**Prompt**: 
"Solve this puzzle: You have three boxes, one containing only apples, one containing only oranges, and one containing both apples and oranges. The boxes are labeled 'Apples', 'Oranges', and 'Both', but all are labeled incorrectly. How can you label the boxes correctly by only taking one fruit from one box?

**Chain-of-Thought**:
1. Since all boxes are labeled incorrectly, the box labeled 'Both' cannot contain both fruits. It must contain either only apples or only oranges.
2. If you take a fruit from the 'Both' box and it's an apple, then that box is the apples box.
3. Since the 'Apples' box cannot be the apples box, and we now know the 'Both' box is the apples box, the 'Oranges' box must be the 'Both' box, leaving the last box to be correctly labeled as 'Oranges'."

**Expected Response**: The model uses the reasoning steps to solve the puzzle, explaining how to correctly label the boxes based on the outcome of picking one fruit.

### Example 5: Decision-Making Problem
**Prompt**: 
"Determine the most cost-effective option for commuting to work over a month, considering the following options: Option A - Daily bus pass at $3/day, Option B - Monthly train pass at $70/month.

**Chain-of-Thought**:
1. Calculate the total cost of the daily bus pass for a month: $3/day * 30 days = $90.
2. Compare the total monthly cost of the bus pass ($90) to the cost of the monthly train pass ($70).
3. Since $70 is less than $90, the monthly train pass is more cost-effective."

**Expected Response**: The model outlines the costs associated with each commuting option and uses simple arithmetic to conclude which option is more cost-effective.

## Conclusion
Chain-of-Thought prompting is a powerful technique for tackling complex problems, allowing LLMs to demonstrate more nuanced and structured reasoning. By explicitly guiding the model through a logical sequence of steps, users can obtain more detailed and coherent solutions to
