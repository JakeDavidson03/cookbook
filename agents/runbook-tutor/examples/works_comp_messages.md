# After hello:

I want to write a runbook for my worker's compensation accrual process, how do I start?

# After LLM asks for details:

[./works_comp_messages.md](./works_comp_messages.md)

# After given:

Let's deploy that one for now!

# After LLM deploys:

## To the other chat:

Let's start this year's accrual process!

## After it tries and fails or gets into an infinate loop:

# In the Runboo tutor:

That didn't quite work, it needs to be able to get some data, how can we fix that?

# When it asks to update runbook

Yes!
