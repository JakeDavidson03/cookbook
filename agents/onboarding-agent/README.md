# Onboarding Agent

## The Challenge ‚≠êÔ∏è
When a new employee joins the company, the person responsible for onboarding (HR/IT/Manager) needs to invite the employee to multiple different company accounts. It requires signing in to accounts and sending invitations one-by-one.

## Pain Points üò§
The manual work is acceptable if you have one employee joining per month. However, if you have multiple employees joining every single week, and you need to log into ten systems separately to invite new employees to those, the amount of manual work is getting painful.

## Example of a current Process: When a new employee has signed an employment agreement, HR will:
1. Create a Google Workspace account for a new employee
2. Send new Gsuite account login instructions to the employee's private email
3. Send invitations to all other company-wide accounts such as Hibob (in the future, it could be any other accounts like Zoom, Slack, Ramp, etc.) 
On the 1st day of work, the manager or HR will invite the employee to all team-specific accounts.

## The solution üí°
Onboarding Agent, which works by command, first creates a Gsuite account, sends an invitation to a new employee's personal email, and then grants other needed access to the internal systems/accounts.
