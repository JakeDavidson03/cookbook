# User Research Agent

Helps the product/marketing/sales team to analyze and create actionable items from user feedback for a product.

## Highlights:
- Classify Issues: I can classify reported issues by:
  - System Page: Determine which page of the S4DT the issue occurred on, such as the Home Page, Agents Page, Create an Agent Page, etc.
  - Persona: Classify issues based on the type of user who reported them, such as Engineering, Product, Customer Success, etc.
  - Issue Priority: Categorize issues by their priority level (Low, Medium, High) based on the impact they have on the user's ability to proceed.
- Assign Issues: Based on the content of the feedback, I can determine which team (Engineering, Product, Design, etc.) should address the issue.
- Analyze Sentiment: I can analyze the sentiment of the feedback, providing a score from 0 (most negative) to 10 (most positive).
- Data Analysis Tools: I can calculate various metrics such as Net Promoter Score (NPS), Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT), and Customer Effort Score (CES) from user ratings.
- Communication: I can find specific messages in Slack channels related to ticket IDs and send messages to specified Slack channels.
