# Basic Prompting Techniques

Prompting techniques are crucial for effectively interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 or GPT-4. These techniques shape the way models understand and respond to tasks. Below is an overview of various prompting techniques used across the industry:

## Basic Techniques

### 1. **Priming**
Priming involves setting a specific context or tone before posing a question or task to the model, helping guide its responses in the desired direction.

### 2. **No-Shot**
The no-shot technique involves posing a question or task without providing any examples or context, relying solely on the model's pre-existing knowledge.

### 3. **One-Shot**
One-shot learning provides the model with a single example of the desired task or output before asking it to complete a similar task, serving as a template for the response.

### 4. **Few-Shot**
Few-shot learning expands on one-shot by providing several examples of the task, helping the model better understand and replicate the desired output format and style.

## Advanced Techniques

### 5. **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**
This technique guides the model through a series of intermediate steps or reasoning processes to reach a conclusion, useful for complex problem-solving tasks.

### 7. **Instruction Tuning**
Fine-tuning the model on a dataset of prompt-response pairs with explicit instructions to improve its ability to follow specific instructions and generate aligned responses.

### 8. **Prompt Chaining**
Using the output of one prompt as the input for another, creating a sequence of prompts that build on each other for multi-step tasks.

### 9. **Analogical Reasoning**
Encouraging the model to draw parallels between the given task and a similar, more familiar concept to apply known knowledge to new contexts.

### 11. **Hybrid Approaches**
Combining elements of multiple prompting techniques to leverage their strengths, such as few-shot learning for context and chain-of-thought for complex reasoning.
