# Bundle configuration for the agent. This is essentially a manifest file that defines the resources necessary
# to deploy an agent.
#
# An "Agent Runtime Bundle" (`.arb`) is a specially crafted (ZIP) archive of the agent code, its dependencies, and
# required resources. Specifically, the bundle must contain a `MANIFEST.yml` file that describes the Agent's runtime
# requirements.
#
# This file represents an example of what a `MANIFEST.yml` file might look like.
